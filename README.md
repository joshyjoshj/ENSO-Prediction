# ENSO-Prediction

ENSO prediction using periodic AR models with non-linear predictors.

This was coded as part of a group project. All R and RMarkdown code was completed by me and is my own work. All content from pages 1-11 is **NOT** my work. Pages 12 onwards is my own work.

The model fit code contains code for fitting Autoregressive models because no R package existed that performed: seasonal/non-linear predictors, k-fold cross validation, probabilistic forecasting/confidence intervals, skill score calculations in an efficient way.
